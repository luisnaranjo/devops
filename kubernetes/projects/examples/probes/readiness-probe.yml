# Example of a readiness probe implementation in a Pod.
# This demostration will spin up a container and will run a readiness probe with the 'httpGet' action to verify if the container is running as expected.
# The readiness probe will be executed every 5 seconds, and will wait 5 seconds after the container creation to start executing the probe.
# Image: nginx.
# Type of probe: Readiness.
# Probe action: Get
# Path: /
# Port: 80
