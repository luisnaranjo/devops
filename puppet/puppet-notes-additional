[PUPPET]
Puppet is designed to manage the configuration of Unix-like and Microsoft Windows systems declaratively.
It describes system resources and their state using the Puppet DSL. The Puppet DSL is based on Ruby.
Resource types are used to manage system resources.
    - Users.
    - Groups.
    - File.
    - Package.
    - Service.
Resource types are declared in manifest files. Manifest files can be used within a Module.
You can either run Puppet locally, or in a Master-Slave setup.

RESOURCE TYPE FORMAT:
TYPE{'TITLE':
    ATTRIBUTE => VALUE,
}
Example:
user{'myuser':
    ensure => present,
    uid => '102',
    gid => 'wheel',
    shell => '/bin/bash',
    home => '/home/myuser',
    managehome => true,
}
